Scenario
Write two functions, Image and getImage, that will return a new image object based on three given arguments: title, artist, and date.

The Image function is the constructor, and getImage is the factory. Using the images data array from the previous task, create a new array, images1, using the Image constructor (don't copy the objects, but just create new ones based on the properties read).

Similarly, from images1 create a new array, images2, using getImage.

Display the contents of images2.
