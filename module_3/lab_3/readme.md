Scenario
Create a Users class that will allow you to create objects containing a collection of individual users (users are created using the User class from the previous task).

To create a collection, use a Map class (the key should be the email address, and the value should be the User object). The class should provide the following methods:

add â€“ add a single user, arguments are name, surname and email;
delete - remove the user from the collection (the argument is the email)
get - retrieve a single user from the collection (the argument is the email)
getAll - retrieve all users from the collection (the argument is the name of the field by which the array is to be sorted: name, surname, or email
Test your solution using the following code:

let users = new Users();
users.add("Aaaa", "Bbbb", "cccc@gmail.com");
users.add("Mmmm", "Ffff", "eeee@gmail.com");
users.add("Aaaa", "Bbbb", "cccc@gmail.com");
users.add("Xxxx", "Oooo", "dddd@gmail.com");
console.log(users.get("dddd@gmail.com"));
console.log(users.getAll("name").map(u => u.name));
console.log(users.getAll("surname").map(u => u.surname));
console.log(users.getAll("email").map(u => u.email));
